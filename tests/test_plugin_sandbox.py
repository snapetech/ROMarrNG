"""Whether ROMarr actually lets ROM Hub confine a plugin.

ROM Hub runs each plugin as a subprocess with no library token, no filesystem
mount and no sockets of its own; its only route out is an RPC back to the host,
checked against the hosts that plugin declared. A seccomp filter enforces it.

ROMarr set `ROM_HUB_ALLOW_UNSANDBOXED=1` unconditionally, on the belief that
its container could not confine anything. That belief was wrong -- the filter
needs Linux and `pyseccomp`, both perfectly ordinary, and neither was a
container restriction. The Hub's own documentation calls that flag "no
confinement at all ... a development convenience, never a deployment setting",
and ROMarr was setting it in production.

So the flag is now asked for rather than assumed, and these pin that it is
never set while the sandbox is available.
