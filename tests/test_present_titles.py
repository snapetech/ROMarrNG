"""What a set plan counts as "already on the shelf".

Collections asked the cached shelf. That shelf is a page kept for the Library
grid, so on the install this was run against -- 166,578 games -- a 1,032-title
GameCube plan was compared with the first few hundred rows and reported almost
everything as missing. The number was not slightly wrong, it was meaningless,
and nothing about it looked broken.

A plan concerns one platform, and a platform is one directory.
