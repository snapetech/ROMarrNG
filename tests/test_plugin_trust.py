"""What a plugin subprocess is handed.

ROM Hub's seccomp filter confines network and execution, but filesystem
confinement is not in place. The environment allowlist remains a separate
boundary and must not hand plugins ROMarr's or its clients' credentials.

It used to be `dict(os.environ, ...)`: every plugin inherited ROMARR_API_KEY,
ROMARR_PASSWORD, PROWLARR_API_KEY, QBITTORRENT_PASS and LIBRARY_PASSWORD. A
plugin needs somewhere to import into. It does not need the key to ROMarr
itself or the password to the torrent client.
