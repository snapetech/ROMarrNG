"""The install command in the README has to be one that works.

Issue #2: the documented Proxmox one-liner returned 404. The script itself
resolved fine -- what failed was two hops down. It sourced community-scripts'
`build.func`, which then fetched `install/<app>.sh` from *its own* repository,
and ROMarr does not live there. Their framework is built for scripts inside
their repo, so nothing we could put in ours would satisfy it, and their rename
from ProxmoxVE to ProxmoxVED had already moved the goalposts once.

The installer is now self-contained. These tests pin the properties that made
the old one fail silently: a URL nobody verifies, a helper from a repo we do
not control, and a README command that drifts from the file it names.

Network is only touched in the tests marked `network`; the rest are static and
run offline.
