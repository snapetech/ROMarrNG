"""The product is spelled ROMarrNG. This is the guard that proves it.

The brand has now been got wrong twice in the same place, both times invisibly to
`grep`, because the logo is split across an element boundary so that "arr" can
carry the accent colour:

    <div id="brand">ROM<span>arr</span></div>

Neither half contains the product name. A source-level search for the wrong
spelling comes back clean while every page served shows it in the top-left
corner, which is the one place a user cannot miss. So these tests read the
*rendered* text with tags stripped, and they sweep the shipped files as well --
a rename is not done when the code is right and the README still disagrees.

What is deliberately NOT renamed, because these are identifiers rather than the
brand, and changing them breaks existing installs:

  * the Python package `romarr`, and `python -m romarr`
  * `ROMARR_DATA` / `ROMARR_PORT`
  * `/opt/romarr`, `romarr.service`, `romarr.json`
  * the default download category `romarr`
  * the image name `ghcr.io/snapetech/romarrng` (OCI requires lowercase)
