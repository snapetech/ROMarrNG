# Source: https://github.com/snapetech/ROMarrNG
#
# Run on a Proxmox VE host:
#   bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapetech/ROMarrNG/main/proxmox/ct/romarr.sh)"
#
# Self-contained on purpose. This script used to source community-scripts'
# build.func, which then fetched `install/<app>.sh` from *its own* repository.
# That framework is built for scripts that live inside community-scripts, and
# ROMarrNG does not, so the fetch 404'd and the documented install command could
# never work (issue #2). It also meant every rename on their side -- ProxmoxVE
# to ProxmoxVED had already happened once -- silently broke our installer.
#
# When ROMarrNG is accepted into community-scripts, their copy lives in their
# repo and uses their framework. This one answers to nobody but us.
