# "latest" is whatever tag exists, and the published release can lag main by a
# long way: v0.7.0 was tagged before authentication existed at all, so a
# release-tracking installer could deploy an API open to anyone who reaches the
# port, on a service that queues downloads and writes to the filesystem. This
# script cannot fall back to main the way ct/romarr.sh does -- the framework
# owns the fetch -- so it stops instead of finishing quietly.

# ROMarr talks to three services and stores nothing else. Every value here is
# blank on purpose: it starts and serves its UI with none of them reachable,
# and the Settings pages say which are missing, so a first run is never a blank
# failure. Blank rather than a plausible-looking 192.168.1.100 -- an address
# that is wrong but syntactically fine reads as configured, and the operator
# then debugs a connection instead of filling in a field.
#
# These are the same names ct/romarr.sh writes. The two used to disagree: this
# file wrote the legacy ROMM_* aliases, so an operator following the README's
# LIBRARY_* documentation edited variables their install was not reading.
