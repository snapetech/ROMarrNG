"""Who is allowed to ask ROMarr to do something.

There was nothing here, and `_guard` -- the only thing that looked like it
might be a gate -- is an exception handler. So every endpoint answered anybody
who could reach the port, including the ones that queue a torrent, write into
the library and rewrite settings. On a home LAN that is one curl from a guest
network or a compromised IoT device.

**Secure by default, with one deliberate way out.** A key is generated on
first run rather than left blank, because an install that is insecure until
somebody reads the documentation is insecure. The way out is
`ROMARR_AUTH=disabled`, for the real case of an install already sitting behind
an authenticating reverse proxy -- asking that operator to carry a second
credential past a proxy that already established identity is friction with no
security gain. It is a setting, never a default, and crucially never something
a *missing* key degrades into: `test_off_is_only_ever_explicit` fails if that
ever changes.

Three ways to present a credential, because the senders differ:

  * `X-Api-Key`, which is what the other *arrs use and what a script will send.
  * `Authorization: Bearer`, for anything speaking generic HTTP.
  * `?apikey=`, for senders that cannot set a header at all. A request
    front-end posting a notification is the case that forces this, and the
    alternative was leaving the one endpoint that queues downloads open.

A browser gets a signed session cookie instead, so the key is presented once
rather than sitting in every request and in the page.
