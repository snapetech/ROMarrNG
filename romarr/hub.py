"""ROMarr's window onto ROM Hub — the plugin layer of the Cartridge ecosystem.

ROMarr acquires games; ROM Hub is where the *sources* it can acquire from live,
as sandboxed, backend-agnostic plugins. This module is the thin bridge: it reads
the Hub's plugin catalogue and installed state through the Hub's own Python API
(the same one its CLI uses), so the ROMarr UI can show every plugin, install one,
and turn it on or off — without ROMarr reimplementing any of the Hub's logic.

Everything here is read-through-then-act: the source of truth stays the Hub's
registry on disk (`$ROM_HUB_HOME`). ROMarr never edits it directly.
