"""Time-based one-time passwords, RFC 6238.

Thirty lines of HMAC and a lot of care around the edges. The algorithm is the
easy part -- the RFC even ships test vectors, which is why they are pinned in
the tests rather than trusting the implementation to agree with itself.

What implementations get wrong is the other three things:

  * **Replay.** A code is valid for its 30-second step plus the drift
    tolerance either side. Anyone who sees one -- over a shoulder, in a proxy
    log, in a screenshot posted for help -- can use it until it expires.
    Accepting each code exactly once is the entire point of the counter.
  * **Comparison.** Six digits is a small space, and a byte-by-byte `==`
    leaks how much of a guess was right through timing.
  * **Recovery.** A phone gets lost, and a second factor with no way past it
    is a lockout. Backup codes are that way, and each is consumed on use --
    a reusable one is just a password that never expires.

No dependency: `hmac`, `hashlib` and `base64` are enough, and an authenticator
app only needs the `otpauth://` URI.
