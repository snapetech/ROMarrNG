"""The projects ROMarr stands on, in one place.

ROMarr acquires ROMs and files them. It does not store a library, serve a
player, publish a DAT, index a tracker, or run a download -- every one of
those is somebody else's work, and without them there is nothing for ROMarr
to automate. This module is the credit made concrete: each entry carries the
project's own repository and site, a one-line description in its authors'
terms, and -- where the project ships one -- the command that installs it,
so the respect is also a convenience.

Categories order the way a person actually assembles the stack: the library
server first, then what plays from it, what finds and fetches ROMs, the
databases that make verification possible, and the launchers a folder
library feeds. `ROLE_ROMARR` marks where ROMarr itself sits, so the app can
render "you are here" honestly rather than implying it is the center.

Nothing here is a hard dependency the code imports; it is documentation with
structure, kept in code so one list feeds both the README and the app's
Ecosystem page and the two cannot drift.
