"""Download clients.

Radarr, Sonarr and Lidarr all accept both protocols an indexer can offer and
route each release to a client that speaks it. ROMarr accepted only torrents,
and only through qBittorrent, which made every usenet indexer in Prowlarr dead
weight -- results came back, scored fine, and were then refused.

Each client here answers three questions the service needs:

  * does it speak this protocol
  * is it reachable
  * take this release

Nothing else. Queue inspection stays with qBittorrent because that is where
the import path reads completed downloads from; the usenet clients report
completion through their own history, which is read the same way.

ON API KEYS: Prowlarr embeds its key in the download links it hands out, and
for usenet there is no keyless alternative -- a magnet has no NZB equivalent.
Radarr and Sonarr both pass that URL to the download client, which fetches it
server-side. That is safe as long as the key never reaches a browser or a log,
which is what sanitise_for_display exists for. Refusing keyed URLs outright, as
this once did, does not protect anything: it just means usenet never works.

    puts the files somewhere nobody searches, with no error anywhere.

    ROMarr's job is the last leg: get the bytes onto a path the importer can

    THIS ROMarr sent, resolves each finished item to direct links, and
    downloads them into `save_path` -- after which the normal import pipeline
    takes over as if a local client had produced the files.

    has a category or a label to filter on, so the ledger of our own ids --
    kept in a dotfile beside the downloads, so that moving the directory moves
    the queue with it -- is the only thing standing between "import my grabs"
    and "import whatever else this account happens to hold".

    how to hand over a release (`add`), which of our items are finished
    (`_finished`), and how to turn one item's link into a direct URL
    (`_resolve` -- and most do not need to, because most hand out a usable URL
    with the listing). Everything under that -- the ledger, the streaming
    download, the .partial rename, the skip-what-is-already-here rule -- is

    write otherwise. Not every client reads those; the ones that do not need a
    torrent URL from the indexer instead, and the field help says so, because

# ------------------------------------------------------------ ROM sites ----
#
# Everything above this line hands a URL to somebody else's daemon and lets it
# do the fetching. The ROM sites do not work that way: they serve files over
# ordinary HTTP, there is no torrent and no NZB, and the thing that has to
# fetch the bytes is ROMarr.
#
# Two modes, because the sites divide cleanly into two kinds and only one of
# them needs anything heavy:
#
#   * `direct` -- the site serves a URL. A GET fetches it. Faster, cheaper,
#     no dependencies, and the default: a plugin asks for a browser only when
#     plain HTTP genuinely cannot answer.
#   * `browser` -- the download is a form POST carrying a per-render token, or
#     a link that only exists after the page's JavaScript has run. Vimm's Lair
#     is the case that made this necessary. A real headless Chromium loads the
#     real page and clicks the real control; see browser.py, which also
#     documents at length what this is not allowed to become.
#
# A site that can only be downloaded from by solving a CAPTCHA, defeating a
# challenge, forging a header or breaking a login is reported as unavailable,
# with the reason, and its plugin stays catalogue-only. That is the finished
# answer for such a site, not a gap.

#: Who we say we are. No version in it, deliberately: downloaders.py cannot
#: import app.py without a cycle, and a version constant duplicated here would
#: be wrong the first time one of them changed. The URL is the part that
#: matters to an operator reading their access log -- it tells them what
#: visited and where to complain.
SITE_USER_AGENT = "ROMarr (+https://github.com/snapetech/ROMarrNG)"

#: Seconds between requests to one host, when robots.txt does not ask for
#: more. Five is slower than any human browsing and that is the point: this
