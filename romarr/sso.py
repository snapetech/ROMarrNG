"""Believing an identity your reverse proxy already established.

Authentik, Authelia, oauth2-proxy and Cloudflare Access all work the same way:
they authenticate the user, then forward the request with a header naming
them. The application's job is to believe that header -- **and only from the
proxy.**

That qualifier is the entire security of the arrangement, and it is why this
module exists rather than a two-line header read. A header is text anybody can
send. An app that believes `X-authentik-username` from any source has not
added single sign-on; it has added a way to become any user by typing one
header:

    curl -H 'X-authentik-username: admin' http://romarr:6868/api/v1/config

So every identity is gated on the *socket peer* being inside a configured
trusted range. Not `X-Forwarded-For` -- that is client-controlled too, and
reading the peer out of it reintroduces the same bypass through the back door.

It also replaces the blunt instrument it grew out of. `ROMARR_AUTH=disabled`
exists for installs behind an authenticating proxy, and it is honest about
what it does: ROMarr stops checking anything, and any request that reaches the
port is in. Forward auth is the same deployment done properly -- the proxy is
still the authority, but ROMarr verifies the request came *through* it, learns
who the user is, and can require a group.
