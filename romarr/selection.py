# cartridge dump of the right game, so every check above passes; it was simply
# the best-seeded of thirteen results and nothing in its title says "hack" or
# "translation" in so many words.
#
# Japanese is deliberately absent. "(J)" on a cartridge is a region, not a
# translation -- the game as published -- and the region ladder already ranks
# it below USA, World and Europe. Penalising it here would push a legitimate
# Japanese dump below a Russian fan patch, which is the same bug facing the
# other way.
