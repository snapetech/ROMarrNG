"""What ROMarr knows about the bytes on disk.

The audit already walks the library and hashes every file to decide whether
it matches a DAT. It then threw the hashes away and kept only the counts,
which meant nothing in ROMarr could answer the one question netplay depends
on: *what is the SHA1 of my copy of this game?*

Without that, a netplay offer carries an empty hash, and the other side can
only ever answer "missing". The handshake looks like it works and settles
nothing.

This index is the missing half. It is deliberately its own file rather than
another table inside ``romarr.json``: a large library is tens of thousands of
entries, and the main data file is rewritten on every recorded event. Keeping
them apart means an audit does not make every subsequent write heavier.

Two lookups, because netplay needs both directions:

  * ``by_sha1``   -- somebody offered me a dump; do I have exactly it?
  * ``for_game``  -- I want to offer this shelf entry; what is its hash?
