"""Proving an import is the right file.

**This is the thing no other *arr can do.** Radarr cannot tell you whether the
file it imported is correct, because there is no canonical hash for a movie --
its last mile is "something arrived, it is probably fine". Every game manager
that scores filenames is making the same guess with a better vocabulary.

ROMs are the exception. No-Intro and Redump publish the CRC32, MD5 and SHA1 of
every correct dump in existence, in the Logiqx DAT format, so "is this the
right file" has an actual answer. That answer is worth more than any amount of
title parsing: a release can be named perfectly and still be a bad dump, and a
release named badly can be byte-for-byte correct.

Three distinctions this module refuses to blur:

  * **Verified** -- the hash is in a DAT. The file is the published dump.
  * **Bad dump** -- a file the exact size of a known ROM whose hash does not
    match. Corrupt, patched, or tampered with. This is the case worth catching.
  * **Unknown** -- no hash matched anything. NOT a bad dump: homebrew,
    translations, new releases and an out-of-date DAT all land here, and
    treating absence as proof of badness would reject good files with total
    confidence.

The copier-header trap is the reason naive implementations of this match
nothing at all. See `header_bytes`.
