"""Import lists: hand ROMarr a list, let the clock do the asking.

Radarr calls these Import Lists -- an IMDb watchlist, a Trakt list -- and the
idea translates to ROMs better than it does to films, because ROM lists
already exist everywhere: "top 100 SNES games" articles, homebrew catalogue
dumps, a friend's spreadsheet, the text file beside a 1G1R set. Questarr's
one list is a Steam wishlist; this is the general case. (Full sets and 1G1R
stay with `collections.py`, which plans them from DATs -- a curated list and
a complete set are different promises.)

A list is stored configuration, like a download client: a name, a default
platform, and either pasted text or a URL fetched on the scheduler. Syncing
a list adds its titles to Wanted; the missing-search backoff does the rest.

**Each title is added once, ever.** A list is an instruction to acquire, not
a state to enforce: once a title has been added -- and later imported and
therefore removed from Wanted -- a re-sync must not resurrect it, or every
list becomes a slow loop re-downloading its own history. The ledger of what
each list already added is part of the list's stored state.

Parsing favours the shape lists actually arrive in. "Top 100" articles
number their entries; people paste them numbered. Comments and blank lines
are what text files contain. A tab or " - " splits title from platform for
mixed-platform lists, and a line's platform beats the list's default.
