"""Headless Chromium, for the sites whose download is not a URL.

Most ROM sites hand out a link and `requests` fetches it. A few do not: the
file is behind a form POST carrying a per-render token, or behind a link that
only exists once the page's own JavaScript has run. Vimm's Lair is the case
that made this necessary -- its download is a POST to `dl3.vimm.net` carrying
a `mediaId`, and the GET-shaped URL two catalogues list for it has never
worked, because it was guessed rather than observed.

The honest way to fetch from a site like that is to *be* on the page. This
module opens the real page, finds the real download control, and clicks it.
Every header that goes out -- `Referer` above all -- is one the browser
genuinely produced because the browser genuinely was there. That is the whole
point of the module and the reason it exists rather than a hand-forged header:
a `Referer` claiming a page you never loaded is a lie about where a request
came from, and this is the same request without the lie.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
----------------------------------
It is not a bot-detection bypass, and none of the following will be added to
it:

  * solving or answering CAPTCHAs
  * defeating a Cloudflare (or any other) challenge -- when one is detected
    the fetch is REFUSED, by name, and reported to the operator
  * spoofing headers to misrepresent where a request came from
  * stealth plugins, fingerprint spoofing, or patching `navigator.webdriver`
  * signing in anywhere the operator has not been able to sign in themselves

A site that cannot be downloaded from without one of those is a site this
backend reports as unavailable, with the reason, and its plugin stays
catalogue-only. That is a complete answer, not a gap to be closed later.
`tests/test_site_downloader.py` asserts the absence of the evasion machinery,
so the guarantee fails the build rather than eroding quietly.

THE DRIVER IS OPTIONAL
----------------------
`playwright` is imported lazily and never at module import, the same way ROM
Hub treats `pyseccomp`: ROMarr starts, runs and downloads over plain HTTP on
an install that has never heard of a browser, and the browser lane reports
itself as not configured rather than raising an ImportError somewhere far
from the cause.
