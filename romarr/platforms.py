"""Platform knowledge: names, RomM folder slugs, and ROM file extensions.

Three separate things have to agree before a downloaded file can become a
playable entry in RomM:

  1. what a user (or GG Requestz) calls the platform      -- "SNES", "Super Nintendo"
  2. what RomM calls the library folder                    -- `snes`
  3. which file inside the download is actually the ROM    -- `.smc`, not `.nfo`

Getting (3) wrong is the most common failure: game torrents routinely ship
readmes, box art, and sometimes several regional dumps in one archive.

# Fantasy III sailed under it, ranked top on seeders and was picked for a SNES
# request -- the same failure as a translation hack, arrived at through size.

# headroom, because a release is not always a bare ROM: it may be zipped, carry
# box art and a readme, or hold several regional dumps. The headroom is what
# makes this safe to tighten -- the job is to exclude PC ports and romsets, not

    This used to hunt for any alias *inside* the text and rank the hits by
    where they started. Both halves were wrong, and measured against the live
    library they answered 4,173 rows about the wrong machine:

      * A bare substring has no word boundaries. "ds" sits inside "Edsac" and
        "pc" inside "Amstrad PCW", so those resolved to the Nintendo DS and to
        Windows -- 753 rows on the Amstrad alone. `selection._mentions` has
        guarded against precisely this since the scorer was written, for
        precisely these two words. `resolve` never got the same treatment, and
        `resolve` is the one that decides which directory a file lands in.

      * A prefix match with words left over is not a match. "Nintendo Switch"
        begins with "nintendo", which is an NES alias, so 2,874 Switch rows
        were answered about a Famicom; "PlayStation Vita" begins with
        "playstation", so 34 more were answered about a PS1. The old
        `_leaves_a_model_number` caught the digit form of this ("PlayStation
        5") and could never catch the word form, because no rule separates
        "Vita" from "Entertainment System" -- one names a different machine,
        the other finishes the name of this one. Only a declaration can tell
        those apart, which is why the compound names are spelled out in the
        table above.

    Ranking by position then made the last case worse instead of better.
    "Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD" has "CD" in it, and earliest-alias-wins
    picked the cartridge machine because "turbografx" comes before "pc engine
    cd" in the string.

    Refusing to answer is the safe failure here, and callers are built for it:
    `Service.request` returns "unknown platform: ...", and the webhook path
    records a failed event somebody can go and fix. A wrong answer instead
    files a download into another console's folder and says nothing at all.
