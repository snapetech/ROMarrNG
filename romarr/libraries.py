"""Game libraries ROMarr can hand a finished ROM to.

ROMarr started against RomM and grew its assumptions: a `/api/roms` shape, a
RomM token, RomM's idea of a platform slug. That made "the *arr for games" true
only for people who had already chosen RomM.

This is the seam. A library is four questions -- is it up, how many games does
it hold, what are they, and please rescan -- and every backend answers those in
its own dialect. Adding one means implementing this protocol and nothing else;
the importer, the indexers and the UI never learn which is in use.

Three are implemented:

  * RomM      -- REST, /api/roms, bearer token from a username/password grant.
  * Gaseous   -- REST, /api/v1.1/Games. Listing is a POST with a mandatory
                 filter body, authenticated by session cookie rather than a
                 bearer token.
  * Retrom    -- grpc-web. Its REST surface fetches one game by id and has no
                 listing at all, so the protobuf wire format is spoken
                 directly.

# --------------------------------------------------- out-of-tree backends --
#
# The four backends above are compiled in, and for a long time that was the
# whole list -- `build_library_from_config` was an if-chain, so the only way to
# teach ROMarr a new library server was to edit this file and ship a release.
# That is the wrong shape for the long tail. New self-hosted library servers
# appear faster than any one project can absorb them, some are private or
# pre-release and cannot be named in a public tree at all, and a house with an
# in-development server should not have to fork ROMarr to file into it.
#
# So a backend is registrable. A driver is a module that calls
# `register_library_backend` with a label, a field list and a builder; ROMarr
# then treats it exactly like a compiled-in one -- it appears in the Libraries
# page schema, routes by platform, redacts its secrets and imports into it,
# with no further wiring. Registration mutates LIBRARY_TYPES rather than
# shadowing it so every existing reader picks it up without knowing this
# mechanism exists.
