"""How a platform will play, answered before the grab rather than after.

A ROM filed under a platform with no route is *imported but dead*: it appears
in the library, it has a cover, it has metadata, and clicking it does nothing.
Nothing about the library afterwards says why. ROMarr could not say anything
about this at all, which is how the README came to claim that disc platforms
"cannot be streamed into a browser emulator" while nine of them shipped with
EmulatorJS cores in stock RomM.

**Four routes, and the fourth is not a failure.**

  * ``local``    -- EmulatorJS, in the browser, from the library server itself.
  * ``stream``   -- a stream server, rendering server-side and delivering
                    video. This is how the machines EmulatorJS has no core for
                    are played. Two kinds answer here: the headless RetroArch
                    stream server, which knows about platforms and can be
                    asked; and a Moonlight host -- Wolf, Sunshine, or Steam
                    Headless -- which is a desktop and cannot be. See
                    `MoonlightHost` for what that difference costs.
  * ``archive``  -- Archive.org's own in-page emulator. Opening a ``/details/``
                    page *is* playing the game there.
  * ``download`` -- always available. A ROM in a library is a ROM you can take
                    away and run on anything, and an operator who asked for
                    that has been served.

**Four routes, and four players inside the first one.**

`local` spent a long time meaning "EmulatorJS", which is one player wearing
the name of a tier. On a library that is mostly Flash and DOS that is wrong
three separate ways, so `local` now names *which* browser player -- see
`PLAYERS`, `routes_for_file` and `PlayerPolicy`. Every player can be turned
off, and where more than one will open a file they are offered best-first
with the reason for each.

**A route is about a file, not only about a platform.** The extension decides
more than the platform does: a `.swf` is Ruffle's and nobody else's, a `.zip`
of DOS files is any of three players', a `.sfc` is a libretro core's. And a
row whose bytes are not on the library server plays on nothing at all -- which
is a different answer from "unsupported", points at a different fix, and is
said in different words. See `ABSENT`.

Nothing here refuses an import, and nothing here is allowed to over-claim.
A platform wrongly reported playable sends somebody to a game that displays
and does nothing; a platform wrongly reported unplayable costs them a warning
they did not need. Those are not symmetric, so every table below fails in the
second direction.

LOCAL = "local"
STREAM = "stream"
ARCHIVE = "archive"
DOWNLOAD = "download"

#: Best first. `download` is last because it is the floor, not because it is
#: bad -- it is the only route that is always true.
_ORDER = (LOCAL, STREAM, ARCHIVE, DOWNLOAD)

#: Not a route. The absence of every route, with the cause named.
#:
#: `download` is the floor **only for a file that exists**. 94,428 rows on the
#: library this was measured against are catalogued and not present -- RomM
#: says `missing_from_fs`, and asking it for the content returns 404 -- so
#: there are no bytes to play, no bytes to stream and no bytes to download.
#: Reporting those as "download only" was the single most misleading sentence
#: this module produced: it named a route that 404s, and it buried the real
#: answer, which is that ROMarr has not fetched the game yet.
ABSENT = "absent"

#: The RomM release `EJS_CORES` was read from.
#:
#: Vendored rather than fetched, for the reason `rom-hub` states and this
#: inherits: RomM publishes no endpoint for its core map, `/api/config` does
#: not carry it, and the map lives in compiled frontend JavaScript. So it is a
#: copy, it is dated, and it will go stale -- which is fine as long as it says
#: which release it is stale relative to.
ROMM_VERSION = "4.9.2"

#: When the table below was last checked against a newer RomM, and which.
#:
#: Re-read from `frontend/src/utils/index.ts` at tag 5.1.0 -- the release the
#: maintainer's install runs -- and every platform ROMarr models still maps to
#: the same cores. 5.1.0 adds `doom` (`prboom`), `c-plus-4` and `cpet`, which
#: are not platforms ROMarr models, and a *nightly* map behind
#: `EJS_NETPLAY_ENABLED` carrying `azahar` for 3DS, `freeintv` for
#: Intellivision, `bsnes` for SNES and the `_wide` Sega cores. The nightly map
#: is deliberately not merged in here: it is reachable only with netplay
#: turned on, and `NO_EJS_CORE` already says so for the two platforms where it
#: is the difference between playable and not.
EJS_CORES_RECHECKED = ("2026-08-11", "5.1.0")

#: RomM's `_EJS_CORES_MAP`, restricted to the platforms ROMarr models, keyed by
#: ROMarr's slug.
#:
#: **Nine of these are optical systems**, which is the entire factual basis for
#: removing the disc exclusion: psx, psp, saturn, segacd, 3do, philips-cd-i,
#: pc-fx, turbografx-cd and amiga-cd32 play in a browser on a stock RomM, with
#: no configuration and no stream server.
#:
#: Two ROMarr slugs are not keys in RomM's map and are covered by a key naming
#: the same machine -- `genesis-slash-megadrive` by `genesis`,
#: `turbografx-16-slash-pc-engine-cd` by `turbografx-cd`. That equivalence is
#: recorded here rather than acted on anywhere else: this module *reports*, and
#: re-filing a ROM under a neighbouring slug is a different and much worse idea
#: than telling somebody which core will run it.

# ===========================================================================
# Browser players: EmulatorJS, Ruffle, js-dos, Emularity
# ===========================================================================
#
# The `local` tier had exactly one player in it and the detail string said so
# on every platform with a core. On the maintainer's library that is wrong in
# three directions at once, and each one cost a real answer:
#
#   * **EmulatorJS has never run a Flash file.** 71,570 rows here are `.swf`.
#     RomM plays those on Ruffle -- it ships Ruffle, `DISABLE_RUFFLE_RS` is
#     false on the live server -- and ROMarr had no name for that player, so
#     it said "no browser core for this platform" about files a browser plays
#     perfectly well.
#   * **A DOS zip has three players, not one.** EmulatorJS's `dosbox_pure`,
#     js-dos, and Emularity's EM-DOSBOX will all open it. Which is best
#     depends on what the operator runs, which is a thing this file cannot
#     know, so the job is to lay the options out best-first with a reason and
#     let them choose -- and to let them turn any of them off.
#   * **A row with no file plays on nothing.** See `ABSENT`.
#
# So a player is a first-class thing here: it has a name, it can be disabled,
# it is ordered against the others, and it is asked about a FILE.
#
# What is deliberately *not* here, so that "we checked" cannot decay into
# "nobody looked":
#
#   * **v86** (copy/v86, BSD-2-Clause) is a real x86 PC in a browser and will
#     boot DOS, Windows 9x and Linux. It is not offered as a player because
#     what it takes is a *disk image with an operating system on it*, not a
#     game: playing one DOS title through v86 means somebody first built a
#     bootable image with that title installed. That is a fine thing to do and
#     it is not something ROMarr can infer from a `.zip` in a library.
#   * **Nostalgist.js** (MIT) drives the same libretro cores EmulatorJS does,
#     through a smaller API. It would add no platform and no file type that
#     EmulatorJS does not already cover here, so adding it would be a second
#     row in the UI offering the identical answer.
#   * **RetroArch's own Emscripten web player** has no loader for a remote
#     library; it wants a file dropped into its virtual filesystem by hand.
#
# Both v86 and Nostalgist are credited in `ecosystem.py` regardless. Being
# wrong for this job is not the same as being unworthy of the credit.

#: cannot open 7z" is a real bug report (linuxserver/docker-emulatorjs#45) and
#: it is stale: `data/src/compression.js` in the 4.2.3 build RomM ships sniffs
#: the first bytes -- `PK`, `7z\xBC\xAF`, `Rar!` -- and loads `extractzip.js`,
#: `extract7z.js` or `libunrar.js` accordingly. It reads magic bytes and not
#: the name, which is worth knowing in the other direction too: a mis-named
#: archive still opens, and a `.zip` that is not one still fails.
EJS_ARCHIVES = (".zip", ".7z", ".rar")

#: Cores that need `SharedArrayBuffer`, and so a cross-origin-isolated page.

#: the page loads, the player draws its frame, and nothing ever starts. It is
#: named in the route detail rather than left to be discovered, because the

# ===========================================================================
# Moonlight hosts: Wolf, Sunshine, Steam Headless
# ===========================================================================
#
# A different animal from the RetroArch stream server above, and the
# difference is the whole reason this section is long.
#
# The stream server was *built* to answer "can you play this platform". It has
# `/api/play/route`, it reads its own core directory, and one GET settles the
# question. A Moonlight host has no such endpoint and never will, because it
# is not a platform router -- it is a machine with a desktop on it. Wolf runs
# containers, Sunshine runs whatever you put in `apps.json`, Steam Headless
# runs Steam. None of them has any concept of "PlayStation 2"; they have a
# list of *applications*, and what those applications can open is a question
# about somebody's filesystem that no API exposes.
#
# So the honest position, and the one every table below implements:
#
#   * A reachable Moonlight host is worth reporting. It is a real play route
#     for a human being, and a status page that omits it is lying by silence.
#   * A reachable Moonlight host grants a *platform* a stream route only when
#     an app on it names an emulator that plays exactly one machine. "PCSX2"
#     is evidence. "RetroArch" and "Steam" are not, and are refused below by
#     name rather than by accident.
#   * When the app list could not be read at all -- which is the default,
#     because reading it needs an admin credential ROMarr may not have -- the
#     host grants nothing and says so. Reachability is not capability.
#
# The over-claim this avoids is specific and was worth designing around: an
# operator with Wolf running sees "PS2 streams from Wolf", clicks a PS2 game,
# and gets Wolf's app list with Firefox and Steam on it. That is a worse
# outcome than never having offered the route.


#: Wolf, Sunshine and NVIDIA's original GameStream all speak this. The base
#: port is 47989 for plain HTTP and 47984 for TLS; Wolf hardcodes the same two
#: (`state/data-structures.hpp`, `HTTP_PORT`/`HTTPS_PORT`) and Sunshine maps
#: them off the same base, so one probe reaches every implementation.
MOONLIGHT_HTTP_PORT = 47989
MOONLIGHT_HTTPS_PORT = 47984

#: Sunshine's admin API and web UI, which is the Moonlight base port plus one.
#: HTTPS with a self-signed certificate, always -- see `_sunshine_call` for
#: why that forces an unverified context and what is given up by it.
SUNSHINE_WEB_PORT = 47990

#: The one thing every Moonlight host answers without a credential, without a
#: certificate and without being paired.
#:
#: It is served on the *plain HTTP* port by both implementations
#: (`nvhttp.cpp` `http_server.resource["^/serverinfo$"]` in Sunshine,
#: `servers.cpp` `server->resource["^/serverinfo$"]` in Wolf) and it returns
#: XML naming the host, its version, its HTTPS port and whether a game is
#: currently running. Everything else in the Moonlight protocol -- `/applist`,
#: `/launch`, `/resume` -- is registered on the HTTPS server behind a *client
#: certificate check*, so this is not a starting point that leads anywhere:
#: it is the entire unauthenticated surface, and it is a dead end by design.
SERVERINFO_PATH = "/serverinfo"

#: Host kinds. Declared by the operator, never sniffed.
#:
#: There is no reliable way to tell Wolf from Sunshine over `/serverinfo`.
#: Wolf emits the same field set, including the literal `SUNSHINE_SERVER_FREE`
#: in `root.state` (`moonlight.cpp`), because Moonlight clients require that
#: exact string. Wolf's stock `hostname` is "Wolf", which is a hint and not a
#: fact -- it is the first thing an operator renames -- so it is not acted on.

#: container that runs Sunshine (`ENABLE_SUNSHINE=true`, port 47990) next to a
#: noVNC/neko desktop. Its streaming surface *is* Sunshine's, so it reuses
#: Sunshine's client wholesale and differs only in what the UI calls it and in

class MoonlightPairing:
    """What a human has to do, and what ROMarr can do around it.

    **Moonlight pairing cannot be automated, and this class does not pretend
    otherwise.** The protocol is a four-phase exchange in which the *client*
    generates a PIN, both sides derive `SHA256(SALT + PIN)[0:16]` as an AES
    key, and the client proves possession of it. Wolf's own field
    documentation says it outright -- `PairRequest.pin` in `api/api.hpp` is
    annotated "The PIN created by the remote Moonlight client". The PIN exists
    on a screen in somebody's hand. No API on the host side can produce it,
    guess it, or skip it, and any ROMarr feature that claimed to pair a client
    on its own would be a lie with a progress bar.

    What ROMarr *can* do is everything on either side of the human:

      * notice that a client is waiting (Wolf lists them; Sunshine does not),
      * be the box the PIN is typed into, and post it to the host,
      * report afterwards whether the host now lists the client as paired.

    That is a real convenience -- it is one fewer admin panel to find, and on
    Wolf it replaces hunting through container logs for a URL with a secret
    in the fragment -- and it is the whole of what is possible.
    """

    #: Pending requests the host is willing to name. Wolf answers this from
    #: `/api/v1/pair/pending` with `{pair_secret, client_ip}` per request.

    #: Sunshine and Steam Headless and the UI must not read empty as "nobody
    #: is waiting" there.

class MoonlightHost:
    """Read-mostly client for a Wolf, Sunshine or Steam Headless host.

    Duck-types `StreamServer` -- `tier`, `why`, `reachable`, `label` -- so
    `routes_for` consumes it unchanged. That was the point of extending the
    stream tier rather than inventing a fifth route: "played somewhere else
    and delivered as video" is one idea, and an operator does not care whether
    the pixels came from RetroArch or from Wolf.

    Three things this can do, and it is worth being blunt that the list is
    short because the hosts are what they are, not because the client is
    unfinished:

      * **Probe.** `GET /serverinfo` on the plain HTTP port, no credential.
        Works on every implementation. Yields the host's name, version and
        whether a game is running. This is the only call that never fails for
        want of configuration.
      * **List apps.** Needs the admin API: Sunshine's `GET /api/apps` behind
        basic auth on 47990, or Wolf's `GET /api/v1/apps` over its UNIX
        socket. Without one of those, ROMarr knows the host is up and knows
        nothing else, which is exactly what it then reports.
      * **Relay a pairing PIN.** See `MoonlightPairing` for why "relay" is
        the strongest verb available.

    Three things it deliberately cannot do:

      * **Launch a game.** `/launch` is on the Moonlight HTTPS server behind a
        paired client certificate, in both implementations. Launching would
        mean ROMarr pairing *itself* as a Moonlight client -- implementing the
        four-phase crypto, holding a client key, and asking a human for a PIN
        on ROMarr's behalf -- and it would still have nowhere to put the video
        afterwards. The UI hands over a host address and a command line
        instead.
      * **Deep-link into a Moonlight client.** There is no registered
        `moonlight://` URI scheme to hand a browser. moonlight-qt uses that
        string internally in `computermanager.cpp` to parse a typed-in host
        address and registers no scheme handler; the request to add one
        (moonlight-qt#29) is still a request. So the UI offers the
        `moonlight stream <host>` command line, which does exist.
      * **Know what an app can open.** See the header of this section.
