"""Catalogue rows captured by the browser extension, on their way into an index.

Some ROM sites cannot be catalogued by an HTTP client at all. ROM Hub's
`ctx.http` is GET-only and clears its cookie jar before every request, so a
plugin can never hold a session, submit a form, or follow a link that only
exists once the page's own JavaScript has run. A site gated behind any of
those is not partially reachable from a plugin; it is unreachable.

The operator's own browser answers this honestly. A person really browsing
sends real cookies and a real `Referer`, and passes a bot check because they
are not a bot. Nothing here is circumvented -- the requests were genuinely
made by a person who genuinely visited the page, and this module is only the
part that writes down what they saw.

WHAT ARRIVES HERE IS UNTRUSTED
------------------------------
The payload is assembled by JavaScript running in a page ROMarr does not
control. Every field is therefore treated as a claim to be checked rather than
a value to be stored:

  * the body is size-bounded BEFORE it is parsed (see `MAX_BODY_BYTES` and the
    check in `app._post`), because a declared gigabyte costs a gigabyte to
    read whether or not the reply is a refusal,
  * `source` must name a site this server already knows, and every `url` must
    live on one of that source's own hosts. Without that second rule a page
    could hand ROMarr a library row pointing anywhere it liked, which is the
    whole attack this endpoint would otherwise open,
  * every string is length-capped and every id is charset-bounded, and
  * a row that fails any of it is counted and reported rather than repaired.
    A capture that silently improved itself would be a capture nobody could
    check.

PLATFORMS ARE RESOLVED, NEVER INVENTED
--------------------------------------
`platforms.resolve()` is the only authority on what a platform name means, and
a name it does not know produces an `unmapped` entry in the report -- not a
guessed slug. `platforms.resolve` documents at length what guessing cost the
last time it was tried (4,173 rows filed under the wrong machine), and a slug
invented here would create an index file for a platform the library server
cannot place.

THE OUTPUT IS NOT A NEW FORMAT
------------------------------
Rows land in `idx-<slug>.jsonl` with a `.done` sidecar -- byte for byte the
shape `build_platform_index.py` and `vimm_index.py` already write, because a
capture that needed its own loader would be a capture that never got loaded.
The `.done` key is namespaced `<source>:<id>` for the reason `vimm_index.py`
namespaces its own: an index file is shared with the Archive.org indexer,
whose keys are bare identifiers, and a bare numeric id could collide with one.

Appends are single `write()` calls to a file opened in append mode, which is
what makes this safe to run while `idx-queue` is appending to the same file.
That is the same guarantee the other indexers rely on, arrived at the same
way, and it is why nothing here rewrites a line in place.

#: carrying links to somewhere else is exactly the shape of the attack, and it
#: is rejected here rather than noticed later in a library nobody audits.
#:
#: Adding a site is therefore two declarations, not one: an adapter in the
