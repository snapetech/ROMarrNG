"""The OpenAPI description, generated from the routes that actually exist.

Written by walking `app.py` for its route literals rather than by hand. A
hand-maintained spec is a second source of truth that drifts the first time
somebody adds an endpoint and forgets, and a spec that documents a route the
server does not serve is worse than no spec -- a client generated from it
fails at runtime with a 404 that looks like a server fault.

`test_openapi.py` fails if any served route is missing a description, so the
drift is a test failure rather than a support question.
