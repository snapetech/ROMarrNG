"""Naming a game, from a hash rather than from a filename.

Every tool in this category matches metadata by parsing the release title:
strip the scene tags, strip the region, strip the revision, hope what is left
is the game. It mostly works, and when it does not it fails silently -- a
cover for the wrong game looks exactly like a cover for the right one.

ROMarr does not have to guess. When a file verified against a No-Intro or
Redump DAT, its **canonical name is known exactly**, so the lookup key is a
fact rather than the output of a regular expression:

    Chrono.Trigger.USA.Retranslated.v1.2.[!].smc
      -> filename parsing: "Chrono Trigger Retranslated v1 2"
      -> DAT verification:  "Chrono Trigger (USA)"

That is the whole idea, and it is why `identify` takes a verification result
before it takes a filename. Filename parsing is still here, because an
unverified file has nothing else -- but it is the fallback, not the method.

Providers are a driver table like the indexers and notifiers. Nothing here
ships an API key, and a provider with no key configured is skipped rather
than failing the lookup: metadata is an enhancement, and a missing cover must
never cost somebody an import.

# appear is doing more than anybody asked". That was wrong about what the
# credential is. `grant_type=client_credentials` authenticates the
# *application*, not a person -- it reads nobody's Twitch account and reaches
# nothing but the games database. What the refusal actually bought was an
# operator pasting a bearer token by hand every sixty days, which is how an
# install ended up with valid IGDB credentials and three pages insisting no
# provider was configured.
#
# So ROMarr performs the exchange, keeps the token for the ~60 days it lasts,
# and never writes either half of the credential anywhere.

#: process, because the limit is per credential and ROMarr answers page views
#: on several threads at once.
IGDB_RATE = 4.0

#: Popularity type 4, "Played": how many IGDB users have logged playing the
#: game. Chosen over the alternatives after looking at what each one actually
#: returns from the live API rather than at what it is called:
#:
#:   * type 1 "Visits" is page views, and the live top of it is spam -- "The
#:     Choicer Voicer", "A Weird Game About Sausage".
#:   * types 3 "Playing", 5 "24hr Peak Players" and 9 "Global Top Sellers"
#:     are live-service and storefront signals: Roblox, Fortnite, Genshin.
#:     A ROM manager will never file any of them.
#:   * `hypes` is a pre-release wishlist counter, zero for everything that
#:     already shipped -- right for Upcoming, useless for a shelf that is
#:     mostly back catalogue.
#:   * `total_rating_count` ranks by who bothered to review, which tracks
#:     what got covered rather than what got played.
#:
