"""Operating ROMarr: metrics, rate limiting, backup and export.

Four things every mature *arr has and none of which is clever. What they have
in common is that each one is trivial to get subtly wrong in a way nobody
notices until the day it matters:

  * a metrics endpoint that is open when the rest of the app is not,
  * a rate limiter that counts the wrong thing and locks out the operator,
  * a backup that quietly contains every password in plain text,
  * an export that corrupts a title containing a comma.
