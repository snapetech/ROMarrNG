# Two stages, because of one dependency. ROMarr is stdlib plus `requests`, and
# requests pulls in charset-normalizer, which ships no musl wheel for every
# architecture. On linux/arm/v7 pip therefore compiles it, and a compiler in
# the final image would be ~180MB of toolchain nobody runs. So the build stage
# owns the toolchain and the runtime stage receives only the result.

# build-base is needed only where a wheel is missing for the target arch. It is
# unused on amd64/arm64 and load-bearing on armv7. libseccomp-dev is what
# pyseccomp compiles against -- the sandbox ROM Hub confines plugins with.

# ROM Hub, the plugin host the Hub tab drives (issue #10: the image shipped
# the bridge but never the package, so Docker installs reported "rom_hub is
# missing" with nothing to be done about it). Pinned to a commit, because
# "whatever master was when the image built" is not a version.
#
# Skipped on armv7: rom-hub depends on pydantic, whose compiled core ships no
# musl wheel for 32-bit ARM and would drag a Rust toolchain into the build.
# ROMarr itself runs fine there; the Hub tab reports plugins as unavailable,
# which is the truth.

# is deliberately not accepted -- see romarr/library.py::_bsdtar.
