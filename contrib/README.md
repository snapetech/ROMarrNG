# Frontend plugins

Plugins for [Playnite](https://playnite.link) and
[LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com), plus the reference for ES-DE.

## What is proven and what is not

Be clear about this before installing anything here.

**The ROMarr side is tested** — `romarr/frontends.py` and its 20 tests. Every
export format is a pure function from library rows to text, and the tests cover
the platform-name mapping, XML escaping, relative paths, missing files and an
empty library.

**The plugins are proven as far as their licences allow.** As of 2026-08-10:

- The **Playnite** extension runs end-to-end against the real
  `Playnite.SDK` 6.11 from NuGet and a live ROMarr — 200 games imported as
  real `Playnite.SDK.Models.Game` objects with play actions, full dedupe on
  re-sync. Reproduce with [`scripts/playnite_proof.ps1`](../scripts/playnite_proof.ps1).
- The **LaunchBox** plugin compiles clean and its `Import()` logic executes
  against a live export — games added, missing platforms auto-created,
  dedupe on re-run. Reproduce with
  [`scripts/launchbox_proof/`](../scripts/launchbox_proof/). The one inch
  that cannot be tested: `Unbroken.LaunchBox.Plugins.dll` is not
  redistributable, so the compile is against a reconstruction of the eight
  API members the plugin touches, not the shipping assembly. The proof harness
  and plugin now target `net10.0-windows` for LaunchBox 14 and newer.

The integration is still built on the exports first: a `gamelist.xml` has
been read the same way for fifteen years, and no plugin API can break it.
A plugin breaks when the host changes its API; a `gamelist.xml` has been read
the same way for fifteen years. **If a plugin here ever stops working, use the
export — it is the supported path.**

## The endpoint they all use

```
GET /api/v1/frontend/export?format=launchbox|gamelist|playnite
X-Api-Key: <your key>
```

`launchbox` and `gamelist` return XML, `playnite` returns JSON. Add
`&platform=<slug>` to export one system — which is required for `gamelist`,
since EmulationStation keeps one file per system directory.

## Playnite

`playnite/` is a **script extension**: PowerShell, no compilation, and it
installs by copying the folder.

1. Copy `playnite/ROMarr` into `%APPDATA%\Playnite\Extensions\`.
2. Restart Playnite.
3. **Extensions → ROMarr → Configure**, and paste your ROMarr URL and API key.
4. **Extensions → ROMarr → Sync library**.

Playnite's *Library* plugin interface — the one that makes ROMarr appear as a
library source alongside Steam and GOG — is C#-only. This uses a Generic
extension with a menu item instead, which imports the same games without
requiring a compiled assembly. That is a deliberate trade: something you can
install and read the source of, over something that needs a build toolchain.

## LaunchBox

Two ways in, and the second is the one to reach for first.

**Import the XML.** Export `format=launchbox`, then in LaunchBox use
**Tools → Import → LaunchBox XML**. Nothing to install and nothing to break.

**Or build the plugin.** `launchbox/` is a .NET 10 class library against
`Unbroken.LaunchBox.Plugins`. It adds a *ROMarr → Sync* menu item and targets
LaunchBox 14 and newer, whose Windows host uses .NET 10. The normal XML import
path remains available for older LaunchBox versions.

```
cd contrib/launchbox
dotnet build -c Release -p:LaunchBoxApiAssembly="C:\path\to\Unbroken.LaunchBox.Plugins.dll"
```

Set `LaunchBoxApiAssembly` to the path of `Unbroken.LaunchBox.Plugins.dll` in
your own LaunchBox installation; the API DLL is not redistributable. The build
requires the .NET 10 SDK. Copy the resulting
`bin\Release\net10.0-windows\ROMarr.LaunchBox.dll` into
`LaunchBox\Plugins\ROMarr\`. This remains the less-supported path because it
depends on LaunchBox's plugin API; importing the XML has no plugin or SDK
dependency.

## ES-DE, Batocera, RetroPie, Recalbox

No plugin needed. These read a ROM directory and a `gamelist.xml`, which is
what ROMarr already writes:

```bash
curl -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  "http://romarr:6868/api/v1/frontend/export?format=gamelist&platform=snes" \
  > /roms/snes/gamelist.xml
```

ROMarr's `folder` library backend already writes the directory layout these
expect, so for most installs the gamelist is the only extra step.
