# ROMarrNG

**The *arr for games.** Request a title — ROMarr searches your indexers, picks the
best release, hands it to your download client, and files the ROM into your game
library.

```
Move Weight
└─ Yarr.It ................ one front door for a self-hosted media library
   └─ Cartridge ........... tools for self-hosting a retro game library
      └─ ROMarr ........... you are here
         └─ ROM Hub ....... ROMarr's plugin factory
```

ROMarr runs perfectly well on its own — nothing above it is required.

On Unraid, the [ROMarrNG fork template](packaging/unraid/romarrng.xml) installs
the standalone `ghcr.io/snapetech/romarrng:latest` image. Map persistent
appdata to `/config`, your game library to `/roms`, and completed downloads to
`/downloads`. Open the web interface on port 6868 to set your password and
configure indexers and a download client. Connect SeerrNG if you want its
request and catalog integration. For package or integration support, use the
[SeerrNG issue tracker](https://github.com/snapetech/seerrng/issues).

[ROM Hub](https://github.com/BlizzHacker/rom-hub) is ROMarr's plugin factory:
it is where a source is written, run and sandboxed, and ROMarr picks the
plugins up from its Hub tab. Adding a source means writing a plugin there, not
patching ROMarr.

If you run Radarr for films and Sonarr for TV, this is the missing one.

## How it works

One request, end to end:

```
you: "Chrono Trigger, SNES"
  │
  ▼
SEARCH     every indexer at once, via Prowlarr or directly
  │          two queries per source — the bare title and the qualified one —
  │          because indexers match whole strings and recall wins
  ▼
SCORE      every release, with written reasons
  │          + seeders, + right region, + carries a .smc, + verified dump
  │          − hack/beta/repack, − wrong platform named, − too big to be real
  ▼
GRAB       the winner goes to whichever client speaks its protocol
  │          torrent → 13 daemons, 8 debrid services, or a watched folder
  │          usenet  → SABnzbd/NZBGet/NZBVortex, or a watched folder
  │          ROM site → a plain GET, or a real browser click where the site
  │                     has no fetchable URL
  ▼
IMPORT     within a minute of completion, on the clock
  │          the actual ROM picked out of the archive (zip/7z/rar, zip-slip safe)
  │          multi-track discs kept together as a set
  ▼
VERIFY     checksummed against your No-Intro / Redump DATs
  │          verified · bad dump · unknown — and only bad dumps are refused
  ▼
FILE       into RomM / Gaseous / Retrom / Gameyfin / a plain folder
  │          per-platform routing if you run more than one
  ▼
RESCAN     your library server is told; the game appears with art
```

Nothing in that pipeline needs you after the first line — and with lists,
connected accounts and RSS, it doesn't even need the first line.

## The tour

Everything below is real: each screenshot comes from the maintainer's
production install (166,578 games, ten live indexers), and every claim links
to its evidence in [docs/PROOF.md](docs/PROOF.md).

### Ask for a game, argue with the ranking

**Add New** takes a title and a platform and does the whole pipeline.
**Interactive Search** is for when you want to see the machine think: every
release your indexers returned, scored, with the reasoning written next to
it, a link to the release's page on its indexer, and a Grab button for when
you disagree. A manual grab flows through the same queue and history as an
automatic one.

The scoring knows things a film downloader can't: that a 40GB "SNES" result
is a romset or a PC port (every platform declares a hardware ceiling), that
"Super Nintendo Entertainment System" containing "Nintendo Entertainment
System" is a trap (longest alias wins, unknown platforms are refused, never
guessed), and that a Wii Virtual Console WAD is not a Genesis cartridge.

### Proof, not vibes: DAT verification

The one thing no other *arr can do. There is no canonical hash for a movie —
but No-Intro (cartridges) and Redump (discs) publish the CRC32/MD5/SHA1 of
every known-good dump. ROMarr checksums every import against your DATs:

- **verified** — byte-for-byte the published dump. Shown as `[!]` everywhere.
- **bad dump** — right size, wrong hash. The case worth catching; refused
  unless you explicitly force it.
- **unknown** — not in your DAT. *Not treated as bad*: homebrew,
  translations and romhacks live here and import without ceremony.

Copier headers are handled (the reason naive hashers match nothing on
NES/SNES), discs verify per-track, and **a verified dump automatically
upgrades an unverified copy** — the only upgrade rule in this category that
is a fact about bytes rather than a taste in bitrates.

### The clock

![The Tasks page: the scheduled jobs with their intervals and last results](docs/img/tasks.png)

Six jobs run without you: completed downloads import **every minute**;
the Wanted list is re-searched every 12 hours with a **per-title backoff
ladder** (4h → 7 days, so a game that isn't dumped yet doesn't get your
tracker account banned); indexer **RSS feeds are watched hourly** in
between, so a release that appears an hour after you asked is grabbed
within the hour; lists sync every 6; dead downloads are retired every 15
minutes (below); and once a day ROMarr asks GitHub if a newer version
exists — and *tells* you, because an *arr that updates itself is an *arr
that restarts mid-import. Every RSS match goes through the same
scorer as a search: the feed can never grab what a search would refuse.
Intervals are editable live; zero disables a job.

### When a download dies

A stalled torrent used to be a loop. The Blocklist existed, nothing ever
added to it, and `best_release` is deterministic — so pulling the dead
torrent out of your client and waiting for the next sweep scored the same
results the same way and grabbed **the same dead file again**.

Now a download the client refused, one that finished with no ROM in it, or
one still unfinished past `stalled_timeout_minutes` (default three hours) is
blocklisted **with the reason attached**, the game goes back on Wanted, and
the next best release is grabbed in its place. Capped at three replacement
grabs per sweep, because each one costs a full indexer search and twenty at
once is how a tracker decides you are a scraper.

What is deliberately *not* blocklisted: `no download client configured`.
That failure is your install's, not the release's — and a blocklist full of
good torrents blocked because a client was missing is worse than no
blocklist at all.

And a request you no longer want can now simply be dropped: **Remove** on
any Wanted row, or `DELETE /api/v1/wanted/missing`. Until now the only way
off that list was an import, so a typo went on costing an indexer search on
every sweep and every RSS pass, forever, for a game that does not exist.

### Lists, and the accounts that feed them

![Import Lists: a synced top-100 and the connected-accounts table](docs/img/lists.png)

Paste a numbered "top 100" article exactly as you copied it — rank numbers,
`# comments` and `Title<TAB>platform` lines all parse. Point at a URL that
re-syncs on the clock. Every title feeds Wanted **once, ever** — a ledger
per list means a fulfilled game is never re-downloaded by its own list.

**Connect the stores you already own games on**, two ways:

| Route | Covers | What it needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Remote libraries** — list types | Steam, GOG | *nothing but a public profile name* |
| | Xbox, PlayStation, itch.io | a token you paste once |
| | **Epic, EA, Battle.net** | one paste from a page you are already signed in to |
| **Local launchers** — a script on your gaming PC | everything *installed*, any store | *no credential at all* |

An earlier version of this README claimed EA, Battle.net and Epic "have no
API" and could not be connected. **That was wrong**, and Playnite and
LaunchBox were the standing counter-example — they have pulled *owned*
libraries from all three for years. Each does have a web API; what none of
them has is an application key you can request, so they authenticate with
the browser session you already have. ROMarr now uses exactly the same
routes Playnite does: Epic's launcher OAuth, EA's entitlements API, and
Blizzard's own account games list. One click opens the page, one paste
connects it, and Epic's is a one-time code traded for a refresh token so
later syncs are silent.

The local scan is a complement, not a substitute: it catches everything
*installed* regardless of store, and needs no credential at all.

Nintendo is the one honest exception: no web API, and nothing written to a
PC to read. It says so on the page.

### Collections: whole sets and 1G1R

![Collections: a DAT diffed against the shelf, acquisition in batches](docs/img/collections.png)

Load a DAT, and ROMarr can answer "what does a complete set look like, and
how far off am I?" — full sets or **one-game-one-ROM** with your region
ladder, diffed against what's actually on disk, acquired in resumable
batches. A 3,000-title set is not an all-or-nothing operation: pause it,
resume it, retry the failures.

### The library is also a shelf

![The library grid on a live install](docs/img/library.png)

Click any tile: **playing / completed / shelved**, a 0–10 rating, and
notes. Wanted and owned are deliberately *derived* (from the wanted list
and the library) so nothing drifts. **Discover** adds the three storefront
shelves — popular, new, upcoming — browsable onto a Request button, and the
**Stats** page turns the history into numbers:

![Statistics from the live install: 860 grabs across ten indexers](docs/img/stats.png)

### Notifications that explain themselves

Discord, Slack, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, ntfy, plain webhooks, and
Apprise (which unlocks ~100 more). Every other tool sends "Grabbed: Chrono
Trigger". ROMarr's message carries **what the scorer weighed** —
`+50 verified good dump [!], +40 region usa, +40 30 seeders` — so you can
tell a good pick from a lucky one without opening the UI.

### Boring, load-bearing

![The live process log, tailed in the browser](docs/img/logs.png)

Auth is on by default (password + optional TOTP, API keys, ForwardAuth SSO
behind Authentik/Authelia); native HTTPS via `ROMARR_SSL_CERT`/`KEY`; the
**Logs** page tails the actual process log live; backups strip credentials
before they leave; Prometheus metrics and an OpenAPI spec for everything;
remote path mapping for clients on other hosts; and history, wanted, the
download queue, shelf and settings all survive restarts. Prowlarr's API
keys never reach a browser or a log, archives cannot zip-slip out of the
library root, and an existing ROM is never silently overwritten.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Indexer** | Prowlarr, or any Torznab / Newznab indexer, or a plain torrent RSS feed |
| **Download client** | 26 of them — qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge, rTorrent, Synology DS, aria2, Flood, Freebox, Hadouken, uTorrent, porla, Vuze, BiglyBT; Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, Premiumize, TorBox, Debrid-Link, Offcloud, put.io, Linksnappy; SABnzbd, NZBGet, NZBVortex; or a torrent/usenet blackhole folder for anything not on the list. ROM-site plugins need none of them — see [Downloading from a ROM site](#downloading-from-a-rom-site) |
| **Game library** | RomM, Gaseous, Retrom, or a directory on disk |
| **Runtime** | Docker, Home Assistant, or Python 3.11+ |

## SeerrNG software requests

ROMarrNG exposes an authenticated integration contract for SeerrNG. Configure
the SeerrNG integration API key in SeerrNG; requests then use ROMarrNG's normal
platform matching, Prowlarr/direct indexer search, download-client handoff,
verification, and library import. The maintained container is
`ghcr.io/snapetech/romarrng:latest`.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/integration/ping` | Report integration/API versions and available capabilities. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/integration/catalog/search-page` | Search the configured IGDB catalog with paging and platform, genre, and release-year filters. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/integration/catalog/popular-page` | Browse popular IGDB titles with the same filters. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/integration/catalog/platforms` | List IGDB platform IDs and names. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/integration/catalog/games/{igdbId}` | Read one game's IGDB catalog details. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/integration/requests` | Idempotently create a request using `externalRequestId`, `game`, `platform`, and optional IGDB identity. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/integration/requests/{externalRequestId}` | Read provider status, catalog identity, deliverability, and retry/cancel actions. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/integration/requests/{externalRequestId}/retry` | Retry failed acquisition. After an interrupted handoff, require `confirmNoExistingDownload: true` after checking the download client's queue and history. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/integration/requests/{externalRequestId}/cancel` | Cancel while the request is searching and before a transfer is handed to a download client. After an interrupted handoff, provide `confirmNoExistingDownload: true` only after checking the download client's queue and history. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/integration/requests/{externalRequestId}/assets` | List request-scoped files found under a configured local library root. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/integration/requests/{externalRequestId}/assets/{assetId}` | Stream a local asset, including HTTP byte ranges. |

The same contract is available under the versioned SeerrNG prefix
`/api/integration/seerrng/v1`. Its `ping` response advertises contract and
capability versions, including whether ROMarrNG has IGDB configured. The
`catalog/platforms`, `catalog/search`, `catalog/search-page`, `catalog/popular`,
`catalog/popular-page`, and `catalog/games/{igdbId}` routes expose ROMarrNG's
IGDB catalog with stable
numeric game and platform IDs. SeerrNG can use this catalog for emulation
requests while ROMarrNG continues to acquire the ROM; PC game requests remain
on QuestarrNG. A request carries `{catalogProvider: "igdb", catalogId,
platformId}` as its `identity`, and its status response reports `retry` and
`cancel` actions that reflect ROMarrNG's current state.

When IGDB is not configured in ROMarrNG, the handshake reports
`capabilities.catalog: false` and catalog routes return `503`. Set the IGDB
provider in ROMarrNG's metadata providers to enable it.

Prowlarr diagnostics are available from the Indexers page and
`POST /api/v1/indexer/diagnose`. They report the management API separately
from enabled torrent and usenet feed searches, so a management connection can
be healthy while one feed returns `401 Unauthorized`. API keys and feed URLs
are not included in the diagnostic response.

Request IDs are durable and repeated creation is safe. ROMarr can stop a
request before downloader handoff; after handoff, stop the transfer in ROMarr
or the download client. The status API returns `409` when a transfer is active
or the title is already available. Asset responses contain opaque IDs, names,
and sizes, never server filesystem paths. Remote libraries may report a title
as available without exposing a downloadable local file.

## Installation

**[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) is the full guide** — every install path,
every environment variable with its default and what a wrong value does, where
your data lives, backup, upgrade, rollback, and a troubleshooting section built
from failures that actually happened. What follows is the short version.

### Docker

Enough to see the UI. No library or downloads volume on purpose — nothing can
land in the wrong place while you are still deciding where things go.

```bash
docker run -d --name romarr \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 6868:6868 \
  -e PUID=1000 -e PGID=1000 -e UMASK=002 -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  -v /srv/romarr/config:/config \
  ghcr.io/snapetech/romarrng:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:6868` and set a password.

`--restart unless-stopped` is not decoration: without it ROMarr does not come
back after a host reboot, and the first sign is a week of missed scheduled
searches. Use an **absolute** path for `/config` — Docker Engine below 23
rejects a relative bind source as an invalid volume name.

To actually import anything, use compose.

> **Upgrading from 0.6.x?** The default port changed from **7878 to 6868**.
> 7878 is Radarr's port, and running both is the normal case rather than the
> exception, so ROMarr was colliding with it on a default install. 6868 sits in
> the gap the \*arr family left between Bazarr (6767) and Whisparr (6969).
>
> If you pinned the port yourself — `ROMARR_PORT`, or a `7878:7878` mapping —
> nothing changes until you remove the pin. If you relied on the default,
> update your port mapping to `6868:6868`, or set `ROMARR_PORT=7878` to keep
> the old one.

Images are published for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64` and `linux/arm/v7`. The
armv7 leg is built in CI and has never been booted by the maintainer — see
[INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md#which-tag-to-use).

### Docker Compose

The recommended install. A [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) with every
setting commented ships in the repo:

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/romarr && cd /srv/romarr
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapetech/ROMarrNG/main/docker-compose.yml
printf 'ROMARR_ROMS=/mnt/roms\nROMARR_DOWNLOADS=/mnt/downloads\n' > .env
docker compose up -d
```

Those two paths have no defaults and compose refuses to start without them.
That is deliberate: Docker creates a missing bind-mount source, so a
placeholder like `/path/to/roms` produced a container that started, reported
healthy, and filed ROMs into a directory no library server had ever scanned —
with every indicator green. Everything else in the file can be wrong and the
Settings page will say so; those two could only be wrong silently.

### Proxmox LXC

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapetech/ROMarrNG/main/proxmox/ct/romarr.sh)"
```

It waits for `/api/health` to answer before claiming success, refuses to deploy
a build without `romarr/auth.py`, and prints the version it installed. Update
later with
[`proxmox/ct/update.sh`](proxmox/ct/update.sh), which reports the version it
moved you from and to and puts the old build back if the new one will not
start.

### Home Assistant

Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ → Repositories, add
`https://github.com/snapetech/ROMarrNG`, install **ROMarr**. Options set on
the add-on page become ROMarr's environment — see
[homeassistant/romarr](homeassistant/romarr/README.md).

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snapetech/ROMarrNG.git && cd ROMarrNG
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # edit it
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
python -m romarr
```

### Volume notes

| Volume | Notes |
|---|---|
| `/config` | Settings, history, the API key and the password hash — `romarr.json` here **is** the install. Back it up. |
| `/roms` | Your library root. Must be the same tree your library server scans. |
| `/downloads` | **The container-side path must match what your download client reports.** qBittorrent: Options → Downloads → "Save path". SABnzbd: Config → Folders → "Completed Download Folder". If they cannot match, set a mapping under Settings → Media Management. |

`PUID`/`PGID` set the ownership of imported ROMs — use the same numeric IDs as
your library application. `UMASK=002` makes new files group-writable. Only
`/config` is chowned, recursively; existing library and download files are
never chmod'd or chown'd.

> **The one rule that catches everyone.** Environment variables seed the
> configuration on the *first* run. After that the Settings page is the
> authority and the environment is ignored — so editing `QBITTORRENT_URL` in
> compose and restarting changes nothing, with no error and no warning. Change
> it on the Settings page instead.
> [Why, and which variables are exempt.](docs/INSTALL.md#the-rule-that-catches-everyone)

---

## Signing in

ROMarr requires a credential. There is no open mode you can fall into by
forgetting to configure something.

**The first time you open the web UI**, it asks you to set a password. That is
the whole of first-run setup — there is no key to go and find first. Once set,
the install is claimed, that screen becomes a normal sign-in, and the password
survives restarts.

Your browser then holds a signed session cookie, so the key is never kept in
the page.

**To skip the setup screen entirely**, claim the install from its environment
before it starts. This is what a container template should do, because it
leaves no window in which an unclaimed ROMarr is reachable:

```bash
-e ROMARR_PASSWORD=choose-something-long
```

**For scripts and other *arrs**, use the API key. One is generated on first run
and shown under *Settings → General*; set `ROMARR_API_KEY` to pin it to a value
you choose. Present it any of three ways:

```bash
curl -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY"          http://localhost:6868/api/v1/game
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" http://localhost:6868/api/v1/game
curl "http://localhost:6868/api/v1/game?apikey=$KEY"
```

An API key also signs a browser in, via *Use an API key instead* on the
sign-in screen — which is how you get back in if the password is lost: set
`ROMARR_API_KEY`, restart, and sign in with it.

### Authentication variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ROMARR_PASSWORD` | Claims the install at startup. No setup screen is shown. |
| `ROMARR_API_KEY` | Pins the API key. Setting it also counts as claiming the install. |
| `ROMARR_AUTH` | `forward` for SSO, or `disabled` to turn the gate off. Unset means normal password/key auth. |
| `ROMARR_SSO_PROVIDER` | `authentik` (default), `authelia`, `cloudflare`, `oauth2-proxy`. |
| `ROMARR_TRUSTED_PROXIES` | **Required for `forward`.** CIDRs allowed to assert identity. |
| `ROMARR_SSO_USER_HEADER` / `_GROUPS_HEADER` | Override the provider's default headers. |
| `ROMARR_SSO_GROUP` | Require membership of this group. |

Two-factor (TOTP) is enrolled from *Settings → General* and applies to
interactive sign-in. It deliberately does not gate the API key: a script cannot
be prompted, and a key is already a high-entropy secret.

`ROMARR_AUTH=disabled` means anything that reaches the port is in, including a
request that bypassed your proxy. If a proxy already authenticates, prefer
`ROMARR_AUTH=forward`, which keeps the proxy as the authority but verifies the
request actually came through it.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PROWLARR_URL` / `PROWLARR_API_KEY` | recommended | Prowlarr instance for searching |
| `LIBRARY_KIND` | no | `romm` (default), `gaseous`, `retrom` or `folder` |
| `LIBRARY_URL` | yes¹ | Library server base URL |
| `LIBRARY_USERNAME` / `LIBRARY_PASSWORD` | yes¹ | Library credentials |
| `LIBRARY_API_KEY` | — | Alternative to username/password |
| `LIBRARY_PATH` | yes | Library root **as ROMarr sees it** (`/roms` in Docker) |
| `QBITTORRENT_URL` / `_USER` / `_PASS` | — | Torrent client |
| `SABNZBD_URL` / `SABNZBD_API_KEY` | — | Usenet client |
| `NZBGET_URL` / `NZBGET_USER` / `NZBGET_PASS` | — | Usenet client |
| `QBITTORRENT_CATEGORY` etc. | no | Download category per client (default `romarr`) |
| `GGREQUESTZ_URL` | no | Request front-end, shown on the status page |
| `STREAM_SERVER_URL` | no | Headless RetroArch stream server. Read-only; it is asked which platforms it can play, so PS2, GameCube, Wii, Dreamcast and 3DS are reported as playable rather than download-only |
| `MOONLIGHT_HOST` | no | A Wolf, Sunshine or Steam Headless machine, e.g. `192.168.0.50`. Probed with the unauthenticated `/serverinfo`; reported on the status page |
| `MOONLIGHT_KIND` | no | `wolf` (default), `sunshine` or `steam-headless`. Not sniffed — `/serverinfo` cannot tell them apart |
| `MOONLIGHT_USER` / `MOONLIGHT_PASS` | no | Sunshine/Steam Headless admin credentials, so ROMarr can read the app list and relay a pairing PIN. Never written to the state file |
| `WOLF_SOCKET_PATH` / `WOLF_API_URL` | no | Wolf's API is a UNIX socket. Give ROMarr a mounted `wolf.sock`, or the URL of the nginx proxy Wolf's own docs describe |
| `STEAM_HEADLESS_URL` | no | The container's noVNC/neko desktop, surfaced as a link |
| `ROMARR_PLAYERS` | no | Which browser players to offer, best first: `emulatorjs,ruffle,jsdos,emularity`. All four when unset; `none` turns every browser route off |
| `ROMARR_JSDOS_URL` / `ROMARR_EMULARITY_URL` | no | Where your own js-dos and Emularity live. Without one, ROMarr reports that the player *would* run a file and names the setting that would let it link there |
| `ROMARR_DATA` | no | Path to the state file |
| `DAT_PATH` | no | Directory of No-Intro / Redump DATs. Loose `.dat`/`.xml` files **and** the ZIP archives No-Intro distributes are read, including one level down beside the platform they describe. Point it at a DAT directory, not at your ROM library |
| `COMPRESSATORIUM_URL` | no | A [Compressatorium](https://github.com/pacnpal/compressatorium) service, for the Decompress task: batch decompress a compressed library, verify every output against the DATs, and delete only the originals that verified. The library must be mounted into both containers at the same path |
| `COMPRESSATORIUM_API_KEY` | no | Bearer token, when Compressatorium has `COMPRESSATORIUM_ENABLE_AUTH=true` |
| `TITLED_NAMES` | no | `1` loads Switch title names from TitleDB — a 65-95MB region file, cached on disk, costing seconds of parse and a few hundred MB of RAM. Off by default; the 1.7MB ID catalogue loads either way |
| `TITLED_REGION` | no | Which TitleDB region file `TITLED_NAMES=1` loads (default `US.en`) |
| `PUID` / `PGID` / `UMASK` / `TZ` | Docker | Process user, group, new-file permission mask, timezone |

¹ Not required for `LIBRARY_KIND=folder`, which needs only `LIBRARY_PATH`.

Legacy `ROMM_*` variables are still read, so existing installs need no changes.

### Backends

| Backend | Import | Scan | Metadata | Artwork | Collections |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **RomM** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Gaseous** | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| **Retrom** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| **Folder** | ✅ | n/a | — | — | — |

`folder` covers Batocera, RetroPie, Recalbox, EmulationStation, ES-DE, EmuDeck,
Pegasus, Lakka, muOS, ArkOS, LaunchBox, Playnite and Steam ROM Manager — they read
ROMs from a directory laid out by platform, which is what ROMarr writes. No URL, no
account, no API key:

```
LIBRARY_KIND=folder
LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/roms
```

### Supported platforms

The authenticated `/api/platforms` directory is the current platform list,
including aliases used by SeerrNG catalog matching. A supported acquisition
and library format does not establish emulator compatibility. The endpoint
reports playback routes separately; recent consoles are download-only unless
a configured player reports support.

**Recent consoles** — PlayStation 4 (`ps4`) and PlayStation 5 (`ps5`) accept
`.pkg` files or complete game folder dumps. PlayStation Vita (`psvita`) accepts
`.vpk` files or complete dumps. Xbox One (`xboxone`) and Xbox Series X/S
(`series-x-s`) accept `.xvc` console packages; PC `.msixvc` installers are not
console packages. Recent-console release names must explicitly identify the
requested system. Indexers and download clients still determine whether a
matching release can be acquired. Packages are stored without decryption or
installation, and no game is declared runnable based on its filename.

Folder dumps require their executable and platform metadata: PS4/Vita use
`eboot.bin` with `sce_sys/param.sfo`, PS5 uses `eboot.bin` with
`sce_sys/param.json`, and PS3 uses `PS3_GAME/USRDIR/EBOOT.BIN` with
`PS3_GAME/PARAM.SFO`. Imports retain the full tree, including assets and icons,
and publish it only after copying succeeds. Folder libraries recognize each
complete dump as one game. SeerrNG request delivery offers a complete TAR
stream rather than a partial file list; it uses bounded buffers and no
temporary archive. TAR streams and individual package files support byte-range
resume; archive ranges seek past earlier game files without reading them.
Trees beyond 10,000 files or the traversal bounds
are not offered as downloadable bundles. Checksum verification remains
unknown unless a configured DAT identifies the bytes.

For SeerrNG, update ROMarrNG and assign these new systems to **Modern** in
Software Acquisition settings. Existing saved groups are retained.

Spectrum, MSX / MSX2, Sharp X68000, MS-DOS.

For Arcade, Neo Geo and DOS the archive **is** the ROM — MAME, FBNeo and
dosbox_pure open the `.zip` themselves and expect its internal layout, so
ROMarr imports it whole instead of unpacking a romset into loose chip dumps.

Disc images are multi-file. A `.cue` is a few hundred bytes of text naming
tracks, and importing it on its own gives you a library entry with a title, a
cover and no game — so ROMarr reads the sheet, takes every track it names, and
files the set as a directory, which is the layout RomM's scanner treats as one
multi-part ROM. `.7z` and `.rar` are read as well as `.zip`, because that is
what disc releases actually ship as.

### How each platform plays

**System → Platforms** answers this per platform for your own install. There
are four routes and the last one is not a failure:

| Route | What it is |
|---|---|
| **EmulatorJS** | In the browser, from your library server. Covers nine optical systems on a stock RomM: PlayStation, PSP, Saturn, Sega CD, 3DO, CD-i, PC-FX, TurboGrafx-CD and Amiga CD32. |
| **Stream** | Something else renders and sends video. Two kinds answer here. A headless RetroArch server, which is how PS2, GameCube, Wii, Dreamcast, 3DS and Neo Geo CD play — set `STREAM_SERVER_URL`. Or a **Moonlight host** (Wolf, Sunshine, Steam Headless) — set `MOONLIGHT_HOST`. |
| **Archive.org** | Their in-page emulator, which is Emularity. Real for cartridge and home-computer systems; Archive.org does **not** emulate disc systems, so ROMarr does not claim it for them. |
| **Download** | Always — for a file that is actually here. |

### Which player, per file

"In the browser" is four different programs, and which of them can open a row
is decided by the **file**, not the platform. `GET /api/v1/players` lists them
and `GET /api/v1/play?file=…&platform=…` answers for one file.

| Player | Runs | Does not run |
|---|---|---|
| **EmulatorJS** | libretro cores — the 40-odd machines above. Unpacks `.zip`, `.7z` and `.rar` itself, by magic bytes. | Flash. GameCube, Wii, Dreamcast, PS2 — no core exists. `dosbox_pure`, `ppsspp` and `azahar` need `SharedArrayBuffer`, so the library server must send COOP + COEP or the player draws a frame and never starts. |
| **Ruffle** | `.swf` — ActionScript 1, 2 and 3. Their own numbers: AVM 1 at 99% of the language and 82% of the API, AVM 2 at 90% and 82%. | Flash **projector `.exe`** files — a projector is an executable with the movie inside a player stub, and Ruffle has no projector reader ([#11539](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/issues/11539), open). Nor Shockwave, Unity Web Player, Silverlight or Java applets, all of which live in the same archives. |
| **js-dos** | DOS and Windows 9x on DOSBox / DOSBox-X, from a `.jsdos` or `.zip` bundle. | Anything that is not a PC. You host it — set `ROMARR_JSDOS_URL`. |
| **Emularity** | Archive.org's loader: MAME, EM-DOSBOX, Scripted Amiga Emulator. It is also how Flash plays on a `/details/` page, via Ruffle. | Disc systems — Archive.org's own `emulator` field returns 0 items for PlayStation, Saturn and 3DO. |

All four are on by default and any of them can be turned off with
`ROMARR_PLAYERS`, best first. Turn **Ruffle** off if your RomM runs with
`DISABLE_RUFFLE_RS`, so ROMarr stops promising a button that will not be
there. Turn **Emularity** off if you would rather nobody was sent off your
install to play something. Where more than one player can open a file, ROMarr
offers them in your order and names the reason for each; where one *could* and
is not configured, it says which setting fixes that rather than saying nothing.

### "No file on the library server" is not "unsupported"

A library server can hold a row for a game it does not have the bytes for —
RomM calls it `missing_from_fs`, and on the maintainer's install that is
**94,428 of 166,548 rows**. Asking for the content of one returns 404.

Nothing plays those. Nothing streams them. Nothing *downloads* them either,
which is why reporting them as "download only" was worse than saying nothing:
it named a route that 404s. ROMarr says the file is not here, says what would
play it once ROMarr has fetched it, and keeps the Archive.org route where it
applies — because that is somebody else's copy, and it is the reason a
catalogued row was catalogued in the first place.

**A Moonlight host is a desktop, not a platform router, and ROMarr says so.**
Wolf, Sunshine and Steam Headless all answer `/serverinfo` with no credential,
so ROMarr can always tell you the host is alive. What they *cannot* be asked
is what a given application will open — there is no endpoint for it in any of
the three. So a host earns a platform a stream route only when its app list
names an emulator for exactly one machine (PCSX2, Dolphin, flycast). A
RetroArch or a Steam earns nothing, because a RetroArch with no cores and a
RetroArch with forty look identical from outside the container. And **pairing
is manual by design**: the PIN is generated by your Moonlight client, on your
device, so ROMarr can be the box you type it into and nothing more. The whole
account is in [docs/design/streaming-hosts.md](docs/design/streaming-hosts.md),
including a list of what has never been run against real hardware.

**What still cannot play, and why.** ROMarr says this per platform on the
Platforms page rather than making you find out at the point of clicking play.

- **Atari Jaguar CD** — no emulator plays it. `virtualjaguar` is the only
  Jaguar core in libretro and declares `j64|jag|rom|abs|cof|bin|prg`:
  cartridges, no `cue`, no `chd`. MAME's own source marks its `jaguarcd`
  driver `MACHINE_NOT_WORKING`. Jaguar *cartridges* play fine.
- **Sharp X68000** — `px68k` is installed and needs Sharp's `iplrom.dat` and
  `cgrom.dat`, which you supply from your own hardware. There is no free
  equivalent the way C-BIOS exists for MSX.

Everything else on the list plays.

Everything else plays. Where a stream server has the core but not the
firmware it says *that*, because a core with no BIOS does not fail loudly: it
draws an error screen and streams it at a perfectly healthy 30 fps.

Nothing is refused on these grounds — cataloguing a platform you play
elsewhere is a legitimate thing to want. ROMarr tells you which route applies
before the grab instead of leaving you to find out at the point of clicking
play, and where a platform has no player it says what would fix it. If your
stream server has the core but not the firmware, it says *that*, because a
core with no BIOS does not fail loudly: it draws an error screen and streams
it at a perfectly healthy 30 fps.

## Usage

### Requesting a game

**Library → Add New.** Enter a title, pick a platform, click *Search & Grab*.
ROMarr searches, scores, grabs and imports.

### Interactive search

**Library → Interactive Search.** Every release is returned scored, with the
reasoning shown:

```
+40  20 seeders
+60  carries a Super Nintendo ROM extension
+25  region (USA)
-120 looks like a hack, beta or repack ('hack')
```

Rejected releases are listed greyed out with the reason. Grab whichever you want —
a manual grab goes through the same queue, history and wanted handling.

### API

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/game` | The library |
| `POST /api/v1/integration/library/lookup` | Look up 1–100 `{title, platform}` pairs for SeerrNG; returns `ready`, `partial`, and exact `matches` from the cached library. |
| `GET /api/v1/wanted/missing` | Requested, not yet imported |
| `GET /api/v1/queue` | In flight |
| `GET /api/v1/history` | What happened |
| `GET /api/v1/release?game=…&platform=…` | Scored release list |
| `POST /api/v1/release/grab` | Grab a release by id |
| `POST /api/request` | Request one game |
| `POST /api/v1/command` | Run a task |
| `POST /api/v1/webhook` | Accept a request event from a front-end |
| `GET /api/v1/system/status` | Health of every dependency |

Download URLs are never returned to a client: Prowlarr's `downloadUrl` carries its
API key, so releases are grabbed by the id issued with the search and the URL is
resolved server-side.

### GG Requestz

GG Requestz pushes approved requests to ROMarr. It is not a `rom-hub webhook`
command inside the ROMarr container. Open **System → GG Requestz requests** to
build the exact setting, or configure this in the **GG Requestz container**:

```env
REQUEST_WEBHOOK_URL=http://romarr:6868/api/v1/webhook/ggrequestz?apikey=<ROMARR_API_KEY>
```

`http://romarr:6868` works when both containers share a Docker network. On
Unraid or separate networks, replace it with ROMarr's LAN or HTTPS URL as seen
from inside GG Requestz. Restart GG Requestz after changing its environment.

`GGREQUESTZ_URL` goes the other direction: it only lets ROMarr show and ping the
GG Requestz page. A green status there proves the page is reachable; it does
not prove the outbound webhook is configured.

GG Requestz 1.5 and newer dispatches when a request becomes **approved**, not
when a pending request is first submitted. Enable `request.auto_approve` or
approve the request manually. ROMarr answers an accepted request with HTTP 202;
an invalid event or unknown platform receives HTTP 422 so GG Requestz records a
real delivery failure instead of treating the request as sent.

The finished webhook URL contains ROMarr's API key. Treat it like a password,
keep it on a trusted Docker network or HTTPS, and do not paste it into public
logs.

## Plugins

**Hub → Plugins.** ROMarr's sources are [ROM Hub](https://github.com/BlizzHacker/rom-hub)
plugins — install, enable and disable them from the UI.

![ROMarr Hub plugins tab](docs/img/hub-plugins.png)

| Capability | Plugins | Examples |
|---|:-:|---|
| `search` | 10 | Internet Archive, No-Intro, Demozoo, Aminet, IF Archive, itch.io, ScummVM |
| `importer` | 10 | the same sources, importing the exact file |
| `metadata` | 12 | Hasheous, OpenVGDB, libretro DAT/Thumbnails, RetroAchievements, Ludusavi |
| `cores` | 2 | standalone emulators, libretro buildbot cores |
| `assets` | 3 | RetroArch controller profiles, overlays, cheats |
| `firmware` | 1 | Open BIOS (clean-room, openly licensed) |
| `stream` | 3 | resolve an item to a playable URL |
| `census` | 1 | enumerate a whole source into a local catalogue |

Install ROM Hub alongside ROMarr to enable the tab:

```bash
pip install "rom-hub @ git+https://github.com/BlizzHacker/rom-hub@master"
```

Plugins requiring an API key (e.g. RetroAchievements) are marked in the UI.

Plugins are third-party and sandboxed by the host — install only ones you trust.

**API:** `GET /api/v1/hub/plugins`, `POST /api/v1/hub/plugin` (`install`, `enable`,
`disable`, `uninstall`).

### Downloading from a ROM site

Sites that serve files over plain HTTP have no torrent and no NZB, so ROMarr
fetches them itself. Two download clients on the **Download Clients** page
cover it, and a plugin declares which one its site needs:

| Client | Protocol | For |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct HTTP** | `direct` | The site publishes a file URL. A GET fetches it. No dependencies. Prefer this. |
| **Headless Browser** | `browser` | The download is a form the site's own page submits, or a link its JavaScript builds. |

**Why the browser mode exists, and what it is not.** A few sites have no
fetchable URL at all — Vimm's Lair's download is a POST carrying a `mediaId`,
and the GET-shaped URL that appears in two published catalogues returns HTTP
400, because it was guessed rather than observed. The only honest way to fetch
from a site like that is to be on the page: a real headless Chromium opens the
real page and clicks the real download control, so every header that goes out,
`Referer` included, is one the browser genuinely produced. That is automating
a user action. It is *not* a bot-detection bypass, and it will not become one:

* CAPTCHAs are not answered.
* A Cloudflare (or any other) challenge ends the fetch, by name, with the
  reason reported to you.
* No stealth plugin, no fingerprint spoofing, no `navigator.webdriver`
  patching, no forged headers, and no signing in anywhere.
* `robots.txt` is honoured including `Crawl-delay`, one file is fetched at a
  time, 429 and 503 are waited out, and a 403 stops that site for good.

A site that can only be downloaded from by doing one of those is reported as
**unavailable, with the reason**, and its plugin stays catalogue-only. That is
the finished answer for such a site. `tests/test_site_downloader.py` asserts
the absence of the evasion machinery, so the promise fails the build rather
than eroding quietly.

**Installing the browser mode.** It is deliberately not a ROMarr dependency —
Chromium is 867MB and 236 packages on Debian, which is not something to put in
a 1GB container that will never use it. Direct downloads work without any of
this, and the Download Clients page says so rather than failing obscurely.

```bash
# On the machine that will run the browser:
pip install playwright && playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

Then either leave **Browser Host** blank to launch Chromium beside ROMarr, or
— better for a small container — run the browser somewhere else:

```bash
# On the browser's host:
playwright run-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

and point ROMarr at `ws://<host>:3000`. The driver runs there, so the finished
file streams back over the same socket and the two need no shared directory.
(An `http://` endpoint — a bare `chromium --remote-debugging-port` — works too,
but that Chromium saves onto its own disk, so it needs a directory both can
see plus a remote path mapping.)

**API:** `GET /api/v1/downloadclient/browser` reports whether the lane can run
here and why not when it cannot.

**Proof:** `python scripts/prove_site_download.py` fetches the same Archive.org
file through both modes and checks the SHA-256 matches.

---

## Multiple libraries

**Settings → Libraries.** Each entry has its own address, credentials and filesystem
path; one is marked default.

Routing is by platform — a library with platform rules receives only those
platforms, everything else goes to the default. "N64 goes to Retrom" is one row on
that page rather than a second ROMarr instance.

![ROMarr libraries](docs/img/libraries.png)

Each server needs its own path **as ROMarr sees it**. The Libraries page flags a
server that answers while its path is missing locally — usually a volume that was
never mounted into ROMarr.

**Gaseous** has no scan trigger in its API and picks up files through its own
background tasks (`TitleIngestor` every minute over the *Import* directory;
`LibraryScan` every 1440 minutes over library paths). Point that library's path at
Gaseous's Import directory, or lower the `LibraryScan` interval.

**RomM** requires the account ROMarr uses to have permission to run tasks, or the
rescan is refused with a 403.

---

## Troubleshooting

The full list, including every way an install can fail to start, is in
**[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md#troubleshooting)**. The ones people hit most:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "Download path does not exist" | The client reports a path ROMarr cannot see | Match the container-side download path, or add a shared or client-specific mapping under Settings → Media Management |
| Results found then refused | No download client for that protocol | Add a client for torrent and/or usenet — the Download Clients page names the gap |
| Any environment change has no effect | The environment seeds on first run only; the Settings page is the authority after that | Change it on the Settings page |
| Container exits 1 with "romarr.json exists but cannot be read" | The state file is owned by a user the container does not run as | `chown -R` your PUID:PGID on the directory mounted at `/config` — do not delete the file |
| Imported ROM never appears | Library rescan refused | RomM: grant the account task permission. Gaseous: see above |
| ROM imports but will not play | Platform has no emulator core in the library's web player | Expected — the ROM is catalogued, not playable in-browser |
| Hub tab empty | ROM Hub not installed | `pip install "rom-hub @ git+https://github.com/BlizzHacker/rom-hub@master"` |
| A ROM-site release is refused with "no download client configured for direct" | The site plugin fetches over HTTP and no Direct HTTP client exists | Add one — Download Clients → Add → Direct HTTP |
| "Browser mode is not configured" on the Download Clients page | No Chromium the browser lane can drive | Expected unless you installed one; see [Downloading from a ROM site](#downloading-from-a-rom-site). Direct downloads are unaffected |

### Remote path mapping

```json
"remote_path_mappings": [
  { "remote": "/downloads", "local": "/mnt/downloads" },
  { "client_id": "<download-client-id>", "remote": "/complete", "local": "/mnt/sab-complete" }
]
```

Mappings without `client_id` apply to every client, preserving existing settings.
The Settings page lets you select a configured client for a client-specific rule;
this lets SABnzbd and torrent clients use different local paths even when they
report the same remote path. Client-specific rules take precedence over shared
rules, and the longest matching prefix wins within each scope. The log records
both the reported path and the resolved path.

---

## Security

- Prowlarr API keys are never returned to a browser or written to a log.
- Archive entries resolving outside the library root are dropped (zip-slip).
- Existing ROMs are never silently overwritten.
- Use a dedicated library account, not an administrator one.

## Development

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

Release selection, ROM identification and archive-entry safety are pure functions
and are tested directly.

## State of the project

An honest map of what is solid, what is thin, and where a contribution
lands hardest. 1,170+ tests run on every push; the numbers below are per
area, and "tested against fakes" means the protocol conversation is
asserted but no live server was in the loop.

| Area | Confidence | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Release scoring & selection | **High** — 100+ tests | Pure functions; every scoring rule has a test naming the incident that motivated it |
| DAT verification (No-Intro/Redump) | **High** — 28 tests + live use | Copier headers, multi-track discs, bad-dump detection all covered; runs daily against a 166k-game library |
| Import pipeline (zip/7z/rar, zip-slip, multi-ROM sets) | **High** — 70+ tests | Includes the disc formats and the header-sniffing fallback |
| Auth (password, TOTP, API key, ForwardAuth SSO) | **High** — 100+ tests | HTTP-level tests: every route checked for the 401 it must return |
| Indexers (Prowlarr, Torznab, Newznab, RSS) | **High** — 66 tests, live use | Runs against a dozen live trackers daily |
| qBittorrent / SABnzbd / NZBGet | **High** — live use | The clients the maintainer runs |
| Transmission / Deluge / rTorrent | **High** — proven against live daemons | `scripts/live_proof.py`: 9/9 against real Transmission 4.1, Deluge 2.2 and rTorrent 0.9.8 — auth handshakes, adds, labels, listings |
| Synology DS / Real-Debrid | **Medium** — tested against fakes | The two that need hardware or a paid account. Protocol conversations asserted; `scripts/live_proof.py` extends to them the day someone runs it with either. **Reports welcome.** |
| The other 16 clients — aria2, Flood, Freebox, Hadouken, uTorrent, porla, Vuze, BiglyBT, NZBVortex, AllDebrid, Premiumize, TorBox, Debrid-Link, Offcloud, put.io, Linksnappy | **Medium** — tested against fakes | Written from each service's own API documentation and asserted call-by-call against recorded shapes: the auth handshake, the add, the completion read. No live daemon or paid account was in the loop for any of them. **Field reports wanted — an issue saying which one you run and what it did is worth more than another test.** |
| Torrent / Usenet Blackhole | **High** — filesystem only | There is no API to get wrong. What is tested is what can be: the release name becomes the filename, a title cannot escape the folder, magnets are written as `.magnet`, and nothing is imported until it has stopped changing |
| Scheduler, RSS sync, import lists | **Medium-high** — 40+ tests, new | Shipped 2026-08-10; live on the maintainer's install |
| Steam / GOG / Xbox / PSN / itch.io list sources | **Medium** — tested against fakes | Credential-gated, so only an account holder can prove them live: `python scripts/account_proof.py <service>` does it in one command. **Run it, open an issue, get your name on the row.** |
| Library backends: RomM, folder | **High** — live use | |
| Library backends: Gaseous, Retrom, Gameyfin | **Medium** — tested against fakes/disk | Gaseous confirmed against a test instance; Retrom and Gameyfin **need field reports** |
| Frontend exports (LaunchBox, ES-DE, Playnite) | **Medium** — output asserted, apps not driven | The XML/JSON is tested; nobody has scripted LaunchBox itself |
| `contrib/` Playnite extension | **High** — runtime-proven | `scripts/playnite_proof.ps1`: runs against the real Playnite SDK 6.11 and a live export — 200 games imported as real SDK objects, dedupe verified |
| `contrib/` LaunchBox plugin | **Medium-high** — compiled + logic executed | `scripts/launchbox_proof/`: compiles clean, `Import()` runs against a live export with dedupe and platform auto-creation. The un-testable inch: LaunchBox's DLL is not redistributable, so the compile is against a reconstruction of its API |
| Home Assistant add-on | **New, lightly tested** | The options→environment bridge is tested; the add-on lifecycle needs HA users |
| armv7 Docker | **Degraded by design** | ROM Hub plugins unavailable there (no pydantic musl wheel); core works |

**Where help lands hardest:** field reports for the medium-confidence
download clients and library backends; a .NET owner for the contrib
plugins; Home Assistant users for the add-on; DAT sources for platforms
beyond No-Intro/Redump coverage; and issues — a report with a log line is
usually fixed the same week. Open issues:

## Acknowledgements

**[Questarr](https://github.com/Doezer/Questarr)** by Doezer (GPL-3.0).
Several ROMarr features landed after Questarr proved the demand for them in
a game *arr: the scheduled search / RSS-sync clock, per-game status,
ratings and notes, the stats page, the wider download-client roster
(Transmission, Deluge, rTorrent, Synology Download Station), native SSL,
and Home Assistant packaging. No code was taken — Questarr is TypeScript
and ROMarr is Python — but the case for those features was made there
first, and saying so costs nothing. As of August 2026 every capability on
their feature list and published roadmap has a ROMarr equivalent, and the
acquisitions here come with the one thing no title-parsing pipeline can
add: a checksum against the published dump.

**[gamarr](https://github.com/JeremiahM37/gamarr)** by JeremiahM37 (MIT).
Several features here exist because gamarr had them first and its README made
the case for them plainly: the blocklist, release profiles, quality profiles,
notification connections, tags, manual import, and Prometheus metrics. No code
was taken — gamarr is Go and ROMarr is Python, and every implementation here
was written from scratch — but the feature set was informed by theirs, and
saying so is the least that is owed.

**Radarr and Sonarr**, for the shape of the whole category: indexer and
download-client registries rendered from field definitions, quality and
release profiles, remote path mappings, and Manual Import.

### The ecosystem ROMarr stands on

ROMarr acquires ROMs and files them — nothing more. It stores no library,
serves no player, publishes no DAT, indexes no tracker, runs no download.
**Every one of those is somebody else's work, and without them there is
nothing here to automate.** The same list, with an install command for each
where one exists, is on the app's **System → Ecosystem** page — because
respect that is also a convenience is worth more than a paragraph.

**Library servers** — where your games actually live:
[RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) ([romm.app](https://romm.app)),
[Gaseous](https://github.com/gaseous-project/gaseous-server),
[Retrom](https://github.com/JMBeresford/retrom),
[Gameyfin](https://github.com/gameyfin/gameyfin). RomM in particular is the
project ROMarr was built beside, and its EmulatorJS core map is the basis of
the playability routing.

**Players** — how a library is played:
[EmulatorJS](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS)
([emulatorjs.org](https://emulatorjs.org)),
[RetroArch / libretro](https://www.libretro.com),
[Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org),
[Wolf](https://github.com/games-on-whales/wolf),
[Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine),
[Steam Headless](https://github.com/Steam-Headless/docker-steam-headless),
[ES-DE](https://es-de.org), [Batocera](https://batocera.org),
[Playnite](https://playnite.link),
[LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com).

**Acquisition** — the rest of the request pipeline:
[GG Requestz](https://github.com/XTREEMMAK/ggrequestz) by XTREEMMAK (the
Overseerr of games — ROMarr takes its requests),
[Prowlarr](https://prowlarr.com), and
[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org).

**Preservation** — what makes verification real at all:
**[No-Intro](https://no-intro.org)** and **[Redump](http://redump.org)**,
whose DATs are the only reason ROMarr can say a file is correct rather than
just plausible.
